/**
 * Open-tab reconciliation after a file-tree mutation (rename/delete).
 *
 * The tree owns the rows; the TABS live in the sidebar state (either split
 * tree, the bottom panel, or free windows). A rename must retarget every
 * tab whose `path` is the renamed file (the editor content survives and
 * later saves land on the new path); a delete must close every tab at or
 * under the removed path — files and anything inside a removed directory
 * (a stale tab's next save would fail against a missing path). Both ride
 * the SERVICE paths (`updateTab`/`closeTab`) rather than direct state
 * reducers so the registered lifecycle callbacks fire like any other tab
 * mutation.
